# Simple Interest

A program that computes simple interest. Prompt for
the principal amount, the rate as a percentage, and the time,
and display the amount accrued (principal + interest).

The formula for simple interest is
A = P(1 + rt), where P is
the principal amount, r is the annual rate of interest, t is the
number of years the amount is invested, and A is the amount
at the end of the investment.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the principal: 1000
Enter the interest rate: 2.345
Enter the number of years: 5
After 5 years at 2.345%, the investment will be worth $1122.88.
