# Paint Calculator

A program that calculates gallons of paint needed to paint the ceiling of a
room. It prompts the user for the length and width, and assumes one gallon covers 350 square feet.
Display the number of gallons needed to paint the ceiling as a _whole number_ rounding up to ensure
enough paint is purchased.

## Example Output

```plaintext
Enter the length of the room in feet: 35
Enter the width of the room in feet:  11

You will need to purchase 2 gallons to cover 385 square feet.
